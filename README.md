# Weather App

This is a weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature in London, and a 5-day forecast for London using a weather API. This was alos a practise how to work in a dev team.

## The problem

There were serveral issues along the way. The group had to collaborate and in order to do that we had to meet several times which could be kind of tricky.
We used a weather API https://api.openweathermap.org to fetch real live data in javascript.

If we had more time we would dsplay more data and add some more CSS-styling.
